# ``SRDTestUtilities``

A lightweight framework that provides a collection of APIs that are useful for unit testing.

## Overview

In developing a number of different frameworks I've noticed that I've copied or duplicated various APIs for unit testing those frameworks. In lieu of continuing to duplicate or copy those APIs, I've decided to put them all in a single library that I can pull in as a dependency for testing, hence `SRDTestUtilities`.
